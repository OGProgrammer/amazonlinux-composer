# Amazon Linux 2 with PHP Composer & NGINX

Using this for various of my personal projects. Feel free to fork or contribute.

To build and push:

1. Build the container image - `docker build .`

2. Copy the tag hash - Ex. `0d190e377fd8`

3. Test your changes - `docker run -it 0d190e377fd8 /bin/bash`

4. Tag your changes - `docker tag 0d190e377fd8 ogprogrammer/amazonlinux-php-nginx:latest`

5. Push your tagged images - `docker push ogprogrammer/amazonlinux-php-nginx`

Don't forgot to login to docker.io in the CLI first ;)
